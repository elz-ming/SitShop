 GAMING-GRADE PERFORMANCE - G203 reports 1,000 times per second, 8x faster than standard mice. This means when the mouse is moved or clicked the onscreen response is virtually instantaneous. 
 CLASSIC DESIGN - G203 is inspired by the classic design of the legendary Logitech G100S Gaming Mouse. Beloved by gamers worldwide and a favorite of esports pros, it’s a classic design that we’ve re-engineered and optimized from the inside-out to be lightweight, durable and comfortable. 
 
 GAMING GRADE SENSOR - Play to your full potential with a mouse that offers 200 to 8,000 DPI delivering incredible accuracy, tracking speed and consistency. You’ll get improved control no matter your style of gameplay1Advanced features require Logitech G HUB, available for download at logitechg.com/downloads 
 
 MECHANICAL BUTTON TENSIONING - Mechanical button tensioning uses metal springs to help keep the left and right mouse buttons primed to click, reducing the force needed. Combined with individual left and right buttons, it enhances the consistency and delivers exceptional click feel and response. 
 
 LIGHTSYNC RGB - LIGHTSYNC technology provides next-gen RGB lighting that synchronizes lighting and game profiles with your content. Customize from a full spectrum of approximately 16.8 million colors and synchronize lighting animations and effects with your other Logitech G devices. Customize it all quickly and easily using Logitech G HUB. 
 
 SIX PROGRAMMABLE BUTTONS - Logitech G203 can be used directly out-of-the-box, or can be fully configured using G HUB. Advanced users can configure any of the 6 buttons to simplify in-game actions.  
 
 ON-THE-FLY DPI - On-the-fly DPI shifting lets you toggle between two sensitivity settings with a click, from pixel-precise 250 DPI targeting to speedy 2,500 DPI movement. Use G HUB to customize the DPI settings to fit your style of play. Also, DPI cycling lets you choose from up to five DPI settings while in-game. 
 G203 Gaming Mouse ONBOARD MEMORY- When you take your G203 with you, your custom settings come along. By saving your preferences to the onboard memory using Logitech G HUB you can use it on another PC with no need to install software or reconfigure your settings.

❗❗❗We promise to support one year warranty service❗❗❗

💻：A band of light, the ‘Halo’, forms the central piece that unites the solid unibody aluminum frame, first seen on a fully assembled keyboard, with the laser-polished ABS base.  Enhancing both the grip and the sense of height, the base's wavy, Ionic column inspired side brings vibrancy to the minimalist, achromatic aluminum frame, available in wear-resistant anodized matte black and elctrophoresis-coated ionic white.

🔌：It can be connected using 5.0 wireless Bluetooth, 2.4G wireless, and USB-C cable connection

🔋：At NuPhy we are always about minimizing delays. Be it pairing with a new set-up on the road, multitasking between up to 4 different Mac/Windows devices, or heavy-duty editing and gaming which push a connection’s responsiveness to the limit, with its seamless tri-mode connection integration, perfect dual-OS support and 4000mAh built-in battery that can sustain 260 hours(all lights off) of continuous use, Halo75 is always there when you need it, and gets out of the way the moment thoughts start to flow from your fingertips.

💗：Designed forMac and Windows.
Elevating the game of native dual-OS support, we have been updating and fine-tuning the multimedia keys layout and function for MacOS/Windows on our keyboards to reflect the newest developments from OS vendors, including the implementation of shortcuts for Apple's dedicated ’Spotlight’ and ‘Dictation’ keys in Halo75’s Mac mode. We will continue to find more ways, and shortcuts, to bring extra values to our users on the software side.

🎨：With keycaps so brightly and vividly colored, it is hard to hold back the urge to indulge in some good’ol mix and matches, and you don’t have to, we have thrown in 17 extra keycaps to make the decision easier for you. Enjoy the extra bit of styling and personalization!

🔈：We love listening to the users, and that is how the consonant, clear, mesmerizing typing sounds made from some of the community’s most creative acoustic improvisations have caught our attention. Combining a built-in Plate & PCB Silicone, Bottom Silicone and Spacebar Silicones, NuPhy offers a complete noise-reduction and stabilization solution for all Halo75 users.

❗❗❗We promise to support one year warranty service❗❗❗
 🔋：Battery problems are guaranteed for 2 years  ⚡⚡⚡

💻：NuPhy Air75 is an innovative 75% ultra-slim wireless mechanical keyboard. With the world’s thinnest PBT spherical keycap, low-latency 2.4G wireless connection, and hot-swappable function, Air75 aims to become the new standard for slim mechanical keyboards.

🔌：With 2.4G wireless and Bluetooth 5.0 seamlessly connecting with up to 4 devices, Air75 can satisfy your multitasking needs at any time.
For gamers and editors who pursue input efficiency, the new 2.4G wireless provides lower latency and higher stability than Bluetooth. You can also use a USB-C cable to connect Air75 to your device.

🔋：Thanks to the ultra-thin aluminum frame and PBT keycaps along with the latest Gateron Low-profile Mechanical Switches, the thinnest part of Air75 is only 16mm. In addition, the 2500mAh built-in battery has 39% more power than NuType F1, which provides up to 48 hours (lab data) of battery life, enabling a whole week of use.

💗：For Air75 to bring a better typing experience, we designed the world’s first ultra-thin PBT keycaps. With form and function both in mind, we adopted an ergonomic spherical keycap design of 4.6 mm thickness, giving you an excellent typing experience on a slim keyboard.

🪛：Each Air75 keyboard is hot-swappable, allowing you to easily replace or upgrade your switches without soldering and to enjoy a different typing experience free of restriction.
We also offer three bonus mechanical switches in the package. This enables different typing experiences as well as easy replacement of a damaged switch.

😍：The backlight of Air75 has more than 21 different color effects, which can be easily changed using key combination. Through Windows software, you can even limitlessly customize lighting effects.

❗❗❗We promise to support one year warranty service❗❗❗

💻：A band of light, the ‘Halo’, forms the central piece that unites the solid unibody aluminum frame, first seen on a fully assembled keyboard, with the laser-polished ABS base.  Enhancing both the grip and the sense of height, the base's wavy, Ionic column inspired side brings vibrancy to the minimalist, achromatic aluminum frame, available in wear-resistant anodized matte black and elctrophoresis-coated ionic white.

🔌：It can be connected using 5.0 wireless Bluetooth, 2.4G wireless, and USB-C cable connection

🔋：At NuPhy we are always about minimizing delays. Be it pairing with a new set-up on the road, multitasking between up to 4 different Mac/Windows devices, or heavy-duty editing and gaming which push a connection’s responsiveness to the limit, with its seamless tri-mode connection integration, perfect dual-OS support and 4000mAh built-in battery that can sustain 260 hours(all lights off) of continuous use, Halo75 is always there when you need it, and gets out of the way the moment thoughts start to flow from your fingertips.

💗：Designed forMac and Windows.
Elevating the game of native dual-OS support, we have been updating and fine-tuning the multimedia keys layout and function for MacOS/Windows on our keyboards to reflect the newest developments from OS vendors, including the implementation of shortcuts for Apple's dedicated ’Spotlight’ and ‘Dictation’ keys in Halo75’s Mac mode. We will continue to find more ways, and shortcuts, to bring extra values to our users on the software side.

🎨：With keycaps so brightly and vividly colored, it is hard to hold back the urge to indulge in some good’ol mix and matches, and you don’t have to, we have thrown in 17 extra keycaps to make the decision easier for you. Enjoy the extra bit of styling and personalization!

🔈：We love listening to the users, and that is how the consonant, clear, mesmerizing typing sounds made from some of the community’s most creative acoustic improvisations have caught our attention. Combining a built-in Plate & PCB Silicone, Bottom Silicone and Spacebar Silicones, NuPhy offers a complete noise-reduction and stabilization solution for all Halo75 users.

🌈：With 2 rings of illumination, 17 different default light effects, 69 RGB LEDs, 16M RGB colors, and unlimited software customizability at your fingertips, the show never stops with Halolight.

 LIGHTSYNC RGB - LIGHTSYNC technology provides next-gen RGB lighting that synchronizes lighting and game profiles with your content. Customize from a full spectrum of approximately 16.8 million colors and synchronize lighting animations and effects with your other Logitech G devices.

 ON-THE-FLY DPI - On-the-fly DPI shifting lets you toggle between two sensitivity settings with a click, from pixel-precise 250 DPI targeting to speedy 2,500 DPI movement. Use G HUB to customize the DPI settings to fit your style of play. Also, DPI cycling lets you choose from up to five DPI settings while in-game. 
 G203 Gaming Mouse ONBOARD MEMORY- When you take your G203 with you, your custom settings come along. By saving your preferences to the onboard memory using Logitech G HUB you can use it on another PC with no need to install software or reconfigure your settings.

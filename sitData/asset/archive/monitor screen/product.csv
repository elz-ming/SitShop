 Incredibly slim profile and stylish, contemporary design Samsung SF350 Monitor has a super slim curved panel at an incredibly slim 10mm*, as slender as a ballpoint pen, the solid curved panel is almost twice as thin as standard Samsung monitors**. Its simple circular stand elegantly complements the slender curved panel while its horizontal patterning on the rear panel provides a stylish, contemporary finish. 
 Incredibly slim profile and stylish, contemporary design *Based on the thinnest part ** Based on internal measurements of the thickness of Samsung SE360 monitor versus the SF350 Monitor. 
 Optimized for viewing comfort The SF350 has the Eye Saver Mode reduces blue light emissions — which stimulate the retina more than other color wavelengths and reduces eye fatigue to provide a more comfortable viewing experience. Furthermore, Samsung’s Flicker Free technology minimises distracting screen flicker to let you work and play for a longer period of time and in greater comfort. 
 Optimized for viewing comfort Extra-wide viewing angle for the perfect view Enjoy extra-wide 178-degree viewing angle that enables that everyone can enjoy the perfect view from any position, whether sitting back to relax or gathered around with your friends. 
 Extra-wide viewing angle for the perfect view from anywhere Samsung eco-saving technology reduces energy consumption and environmental impact With the energy-saving auto brightness setting, Samsung’s eco-saving technology fluidly adjusts display brightness based on the luminescence of screen blacks to reduce energy consumption by up to 10%*. The dual manual brightness settings also allow screen brightness to be set manually to 25% or 50% of maximum to reduce energy consumption. 
 Samsung eco-saving technology reduces energy consumption and environmental impact * Based on internal testing by measuring power consumption during eco-saving of the SE350 when playing ES6.0 Video, White Pattern and Black Pattern in 2 scenarios: brightness condition when switched off versus switched on auto mode after 10 minutes; and brightness set to 65% when switched off versus switched on auto mode after 10 minutes. Actual energy consumption may be different due to operating environment.
